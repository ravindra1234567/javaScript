Q1. How can you create an object in JavaScript ?

Ans. 
	JavaScript is a flexible object-oriented language when it comes to syntax. we will see the different ways to instantiate objects in JavaScript.
Before we proceed it is important to note that JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes, rather than being class-based. Because of this different basis, it can be less apparent how JavaScript allows you to create hierarchies of objects and to have an inheritance of properties and their values.
We can create an object in javascript 4 Different Ways

1) Creating object with a constructor : -
One of the easiest way to instantiate an object in JavaScript. Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below:-
//simple function 
function vehicle(name,maker,engine){ 
	this.name = name; 
	this.maker = maker; 
	this.engine = engine; 
} 
//new keyword to create an object 
let car = new vehicle('GT','BMW','1998cc'); 
//property accessors 
console.log(car.name); 
console.log(car.maker); 
console.log(car['engine']); 




2) Using object literals:-

Literals are smaller and simpler ways to define objects.We simple define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below:
// Create object with object literal
let car1 = {
name1: "GT",
marker1 : "BMW",
engine1 : "1888cc"
};
car1.color = "Red"; // Add new property color
// Property accessors
console.log("Create an object with object literal");
console.log(car1.name1); // access using dot opearator(.) notation 
console.log(car1['engine1']); // access using bracket [] notation
console.log(car1)

3) Creating object with Object.create() method:-
The Object.create() method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
// Create object using Object.create method
const info = {
college : " ",
printinfo : function(){
console.log(`My name is ${this.name} . I am from ${this.place}. I am studing ${this.college}`);
}
};
const obj = Object.create(info);
obj.name = "Ravindra kumar kushwaha";
obj.college = "IET-DAVV";
obj.place = "Chhatarpur";
console.log("Create object using Object.create method");
obj.printinfo();

4) Using es6 classes:-
ES6 supports class concept like any other Statically typed or object oriented language. So, object can be created out of a class in javascript as well as shown below :-
// Create object using es6 classes
class Employee{
constructor(name,email,age){
this.name = name;
this.email = email;
this.age = age;
}
}
let obj1 = new Employee("Ravindra","ravindrakushwahanwg@gmail.com",21);
console.log("Create object using es6 classes");
console.log(obj1.name);
console.log(obj1);
